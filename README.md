#  Dataset Overview:
The dataset contained sales transactions with columns including:

# Data Cleaning Steps:
1. Imported *Sample Superstore (CSV)* into Power BI.
2. In the Power Query Editor:
   * Made sure Order Date and Ship Date  --> Date type.
   * Made sure Sales and Profit --> Decimal Number type.
   * Made sure Region and Category -->Text type.
3. Removed any unnecessary/blank rows & columns.
4. Added a new column Month-Year by extracting it from Order Date using:

   MonthYear = FORMAT([Order Date], "MMM-YYYY")
   
# Dashboard Design:
The development of the dashboard included the following:
1. Line Chart - Sales trend over Month-Year
2. Bar Chart - Sales by Region

2. The *Technology category* was the highest contributor in revenue.
3. Sales peaked in *December* and declined in *February*.
4. *Office Supplies* category had steady sales but in moderate amounts relative to other categories.
